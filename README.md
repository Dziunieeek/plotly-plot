# plotly-plot

Polymer element for the [plotly.js](https://plot.ly/javascript/) library.

`<plotly-plot>` provides a thin, fully-functional interface to the core of the
library. The key properties of the plot, `data`, `layout`, and `config`, are
all exposed as Polymer properties; updates to these properties via `.set` will
automatically trigger redrawing.

All of the update methods provided with plotly.js have been exposed:
`redraw`, `restyle`, and `relayout`. The other methods are also
available for dynamic updates: `addTraces`, `deleteTraces`, and `moveTraces`.

Finally, the custom plotly-specific events are also replicated as polymer
events.

## Using plotly-plot

Install the element with Bower by adding it to your project's dependencies.

Import the element into your project by using an HTML import, as with any other
Polymer element:

```html
<link rel="import" href="../paper-button/paper-button.html">
```

## Developing/contributing to `plotly-plot`

### Installing Dependencies

Element dependencies are managed via [Bower](http://bower.io/).

Installing Bower:

    npm install -g bower

Installing dependencies:

    bower install


### Linting

[Polylint](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/polylint) can be used to take into
account Polymer linting specificities.

Installing Polylint:

    npm install -g polylint

Running Polylint:

	polylint -i polymer-plot.html

Polylint [documentation](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/polylint#polylint).


### Dev server

[Polyserve](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/polyserve) makes it easy to use the
element while keeping bower dependencies in line. It works well as a development
server.

Installing Polyserve:

    npm install -g polyserve

Running Polyserve:

    polyserve

Once running, `http://localhost:8080/components/plotly-plot/`, shows the
index page of the element.


### Testing

Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/components/plotly-plot/test/` (as served
by Polyserve) to run the tests.

### web-component-tester

The tests are compatible with [web-component-tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester).

Installing `web-component-testser`:

    npm install -g web-component-tester

Running all tests on chrome:

    wct

#### WCT Tips

`wct -l chrome` will only run tests in chrome.

`wct -p` will keep the browsers alive after test runs (refresh to re-run).

`wct test/some-file.html` will test only the files you specify.

### NPM

This project contains a `package.json` file which contains all of the necessary
dependencies and scripts to make it easy to install and run with `npm` as well.
